## Welcome to Rose's Lab 5

This lab involved working in Postman

### Postman
We started by creating a CIT 281 collection and folder within postman. From there we created a Node.js and fastify server to support GET and to then respond with JSON. We used the command "npm init -y" and npm install --save fastify" to initialize our folder with a package.json file and add fastify to our project. We then used Postman to test server GET routes
